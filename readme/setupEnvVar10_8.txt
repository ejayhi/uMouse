How To: Set an Environment Variable in Mac OS X

NOTES:
	- 'launchd' will be avail to all programs on the 
		system
	- this approach is for global env variables 
		only
	
	- limitations:
		- paths cannot reference other paths,
		- cannot have spaces
		
	-/etc/launchd.conf does not exist by default
	
	- a reboot is necessary to load the contents
		of '/etc/launchd.conf'
		
PROCEDURE:
	1. Open up a terminal.
	2. Do cmd 'sudo vim /etc/launchd.conf'
	3. Type in the 1st line 'setenv <key> <value>'
		- <key> is the variable name e.g. PATH
		- <value> is the path to that variable e.g.
			/usr/local
	4. Quit & Save
	5. Reboot the system
